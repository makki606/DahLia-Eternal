# GEOGRAPHY

## LANTANÃ†A

The country in which the events of the novel happens.
Lantana is a flower. The flower bushes look nice.

The nation is divided in a few kingdoms, ZaYue and Ollantea being the two main ones.
I imagine the country to look like the Zelda OOT World map. Ollantea is Hyrule Castle + Kakariko village and ZaYue occupies the land of Zora's Domain, The Lost Woods and Kokiri Forest.

### OLLANTEA

I imagine Ollantea to look like Baldur's Gate, specially the Lower City.

### ZAYUE

ZaYue is a land of ruins.
