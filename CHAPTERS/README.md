# INTRO

*change to 1st p pov*

**Leif** (temporary) is an adult human who enjoys playing games during his free time.
One day, he received a zip file from an unknown sender asking him to play and review the beta version of an upcoming game, **DahLia: Eternal Bloom**, set to release the next year. Leif, blinded by excitement, quickly installed the game to test it out.
He spent all night testing every mechanic, searching every corner, appreciating the tiny details. When he was finally satisfied, he fell asleep like a rock.

He woke up. "I'm late to work!" BAM! He hit his head on hard glass.
Confused, he came to realize he was trapped inside a pod capsule, surrounded by strange humanoid beings which he soon recognised as the **Fae** race, from the game.


*(Spoken in their language.)*

*"He woke up!"*
*"As the prophecy foretold…!"*
*"Is this the saviour?!"*
*"He's pretty ugly. Why is he so below-average?* *What's this bland ahh skin?"*

*"Make way to the queen!!!"*

An older, 8 feet tall Fae, adorned with luxurious clothing and precious gems approaches the pod.

Q *"Open it."*
S1 *"Your Majesty, are you sure?"*
Q *"Don't make me repeat myself."*
S1 *"Yes, Your Majesty."*

The glass wall rises above his sight and fresh air makes its way to his lungs.

L "Phew! How nice it is to breathe!"

Q *"Bring the translator."*

A few moments later, a servant comes back with an enormous Parotia bird.

Q *"What is the meaning of this…? I requested the translator, why did you bring…a bird?*

S1 *"It, it was the summoner [a survivor, cultist], Your Majesty. She said the bird could speak and understand the creature's language."*

Q *"Sigh. Bird, I demand you speak to this scrawny creature."*

E "Pruu, pruu, pruu?"

*What's your name, boy?* Did Leif hear it right? He wasn't understanding a single thing the Fae were speaking until this bird came out of nowhere and asked for his name in English.

L "Leif."

E "Do you know why you're here, Leif?!"
L "N-no…I have no idea."
E: "Me too! CAW CAW CAW!"

For some reason, Leif felt like punching the bird.

E "My owner summoned you to this world and only said three words: Guide Human to Her."

L "Those are four words."

E "CAWCAWCAW!!! Let us hear what the queen has to say, shall we? Or else we will have way more than three words we don't understand!!!"

The bird directed his gaze to the queen and they exchanged a few words. The following moment, Leif was taken by the servants and brought to a giant hall inside the building, which he assumed to be a castle. The queen sat on her golden throne at the center of the hall, facing Leif who was put behind a stand with a single sheet of paper on it. It had some writing but Leif couldn't read shit.

Q *"Leif, the Human!"*
E "Leif, the Human! CAWW!"

Q *"You were summoned by this court in order to rescue and save my daughter, Princess DahLia."*
E "You were summoned by this court in order to rescue and save her daughter, Princess DahLia."

Q *"As to why you were chosen, an inferior creature of an unknown dimension, it was according to the visions of this nation's most renowned clairvoyant [another survivor, cultist] who claimed that a human summoned a week after the Princess is kidnapped would bring eternal fortune and prosperity to this kingdom."*
E "As to why you were chosen, an inferior creature of an unknown dimension, it was according to the visions of this nation's most renowned clairvoyant who claimed that a human summoned a week after the Princess is kidnapped would bring eternal fortune and prosperity to this kingdom. "

Q *"Therefore, we brought you here and now give you a purpose: rescue our Princess."*
E "Therefore, they brought you here and now give you a purpose: rescue their Princess."

Q *"If you refuse to comply with our request, you will be imprisoned in this world and obliged to serve a prison sentence of a hundred years."*
E "CAWWW?!! If you refuse to comply with their request, you will be imprisoned in this world and obliged to serve a prison sentence of a hundred years?!?!"

Q *"However, in case you successfully bring our Princess back safely. We will grant you a wish you may carry back to your dimension, as long as it is in a material state."*
E "...However, in case you successfully bring their Princess back safely. They will grant you a wish you may carry back to your dimension, as long as it is in a material state."

Q *"Please, sign our contract claiming that you are aware of the consequences and that you swear to bring back Princess DahLia."*
E "Please, sign their contract claiming that you are aware of the consequences and that you swear to bring back Princess DahLia."

Leif was too stunned to speak or act.


…

**[SCENE: ERIK TELLS THE STORY OF THE WAR BETWEEN OLLANTEA ZAYUE]**

E "Leif boy, lemme tell you a story."

E "Long, long, oh, so long ago, there were the kingdoms Ollantea and ZaYue, enemies ever since birth."

E "They were terrible in making peace negotiations, but managed to keep their hostility controlled. They both had a line of strong, prideful and wise kings."

E "One day, the king of Ollantea was mysteriously murdered. Chaos took over the kingdom. Who murdered the king?"

E "ZaYue's people were the first to blame. And they took it as an outrageous offense. 'Our people did not kill your stupid king!' they all exclaimed."

E "Amidst the turmoil happening in Ollantea, a brave, peculiar noble stood up and rose to the throne. King Thorgils."

E "He, with incredible eloquence and charisma, calmed down the hearts of the Ollantea people. He closed the walls and blocked entry of anything related to ZaYue. He gave speeches convincing the people they didn't need ZaYue. He brutally persecuted each and everyone possibly related to their biggest enemy."

E "The result? War was the answer. ZaYue, upon Ollantea's actions, declared war against it, loud and clear."

E "Thus, marking which would be the start of a five decades long war and consequently, the end of the ZaYue Kingdom."

E "ZaYue had always excelled in the military compared to Ollantea. They had the best strategic minds and strong-willed soldiers. They were set to win from the start. Nearing the end of the five decades, Ollantea found itself in a declining state."

E "The ZaYue leaders were convinced of its victory. Nothing bad could possibly happen to them."

E "Except for the unimaginable."

E "A dark, pitch black, nimbus cloud began forming and covering the skies of ZaYue. That day, an ugly, miserable curse fell upon the kingdom."

E "The curse corroded buildings, killed crops, and corrupted both animals and people. Gradually, everyone was fighting themselves for survival, committing all sin known to mankind. They succumbed to the evil and became monsters, unrecognizable creatures made of darkness. Irrational and violent."

E "Decades passed. The curse dissolved itself, but ZaYue was no more. Shattered and left in ruins. The creatures of darkness isolated themselves inside the remnants of the kingdom and nature swept in occupying every inch possible. The few survivors that managed to escape the curse are known to live, hiding in the shadows of Ollantea."

E "Ollantea rebuilt itself in glory after its victory. Many history books were published, songs written, poems recited, all praising the great comeback and rise of the Ollantea Kingdom. Prosperity and wealth took over, all which would last until the present day."

E "And that concludes the story."

L "What? What about the origin of the curse? There's no way it came outta nowhere."

E "That's the thing, Leif boy. No one knows. No one cared enough to discover. And the ones who would probably know, hide away and would rather not speak about it."

E "A curse that decimated an entire kingdom. Who would want to have anything to do with it?"

E "Now, rumour has it that the sudden disappearance of the Princess has to do with this old curse. She was last seen near the border of the two kingdoms."

E "...Think, Leif boy. Why would they choose you? Why bring a human here?"

L "...Because…Because I am easily disposable."

E "That's it. You get it, Leif boy. CAWW!!!"


Leif and Erik are taken to the entrance of ZaYue.

security: "I'm afraid this is how far we can take you, gentlemen."
security: "Take your belongings. From here onwards, there will be no way for you to contact us. Take care."
E: "Thank you, sir! We will take care! CAW!"
